# spark join two spark files
Iâ€™ve been trying some coding with spark those days and try to find real case needed in the industry.
In Real case Big Data project We need sometimes an easy way to join two CSVs files without loading them in HDFS and join them with hive or wherever.
I read many tutorials to find out the best way and one of the easiest way is to use Spark. (link to tutorials will be shared).
